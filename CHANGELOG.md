# Changelog

All notable changes to bastra-recall are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Statusline memory count now stays correct across sessions. The daemon
  publishes the live vault size to a shared file — refreshed on every index
  change plus a periodic disk reconcile — and the statusline segment reads it.
  Previously an idle session kept showing a stale count after another session
  (or an external write the file watcher missed) changed the vault, because the
  per-session feed only refreshed on that session's own tool calls.

## [0.6.5-beta.1] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- Auto-update (opt-in): a new `update.mode` setting (`notify` default / `auto` /
  `off`) stored in `~/.bastra/cli-settings.json`. In `auto`, a new Claude Code
  session stages an update in the background (file swap, no daemon restart),
  throttled to once per day — the running session is never disrupted and the new
  code goes live on the next daemon start.
- `bastra` with no arguments now prints a status panel: version, update status,
  daemon health, and live vault size.
- `bastra config get|set update.mode` to read or change the update mode.
- `bastra update --staged` — swaps files without restarting the daemon (used by
  the session-start auto-update).
- Live memory count: `Vault.reconcile()` and `GET /vault/count` reconcile the
  index against disk, so the status panel's count stays correct even when the
  cloud-storage file watcher misses external writes or deletes.
- Public `fixtures/sample-vault` smoke fixture so recall quality can be tested
  from a fresh clone without private data.
- Security policy, Dependabot config, dependency review, CodeQL, OpenSSF
  Scorecard, and manual npm publish workflow with provenance.
- OpenAPI starter spec for REST / ChatGPT Actions integrations.

### Changed
- Smoke tests now run against the public sample vault.
- npm packaging is hardened for public workspaces and packaged Skill assets.
- Homebrew formula builds the full monorepo so daemon hooks and statusline are
  installed together.
- Claude Code Stop save-eval hook is opt-in (`--with-stop-hook`) because its
  multi-line suggestions can add terminal noise.

### Fixed
- Lockfile: restored the `@esbuild/*` platform-binary entries that a prior
  `npm update` had dropped. Without them `npm ci` (and the tsx test runner)
  failed on a clean install on the affected platform.

## [0.6.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-29

First public (pre-release) build. `0.x` signals the API may still change;
the `-beta` tag means it's feature-complete enough to use but may have rough
edges. Dogfooded daily against a real vault.

### Core
- **Memory vault** over plain markdown files with YAML frontmatter — your
  data stays as readable files you own.
- **Hybrid recall** — BM25 keyword search fused with optional embeddings
  (Ollama or OpenAI), with staleness ranking and a query cache.
- **Lean-by-default `recall`/`load_memory`** — `recall` returns slim
  candidates; `load_memory` fetches full content only for what you need
  (`verbosity:"full"` opts back in). ~32% smaller recall payloads.
- **`save_memory`** with typed entries (lesson, preference, decision,
  project-fact, …) and auto-related wikilink enrichment.
- **Documents** — `find_document` / `read_document` over PDFs, scans, notes.

### Daemon
- Single shared daemon (MCP over stdio + HTTP REST), spawned on demand by a
  forwarder so every AI client shares one vault/index — no N-copies sync bug.
- **Idle self-shutdown** (default 30 min, env-tunable) — keeps the process
  table clean; respawns on the next recall.
- Background update-check against GitHub releases.

### Reflex layer (hooks)
- SessionStart + PreToolUse hooks surface relevant memories automatically,
  before you write code or start a session.

### CLI & distribution
- `bastra install | uninstall | doctor | update` across Claude Code,
  Claude Desktop, and Cursor.
- Homebrew formula (head build) + double-click installer.

### Statusline
- Optional powerline-style statusline with a native `bastra` segment
  (live recall stats + vault size).

### Tooling
- CI (GitHub Actions): `npm ci` → build → type-check → test on a Node 20/22
  matrix, on every push and PR.
