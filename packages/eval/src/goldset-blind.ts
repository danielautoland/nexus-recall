/**
 * Step 0 for the categories no harvester can reach (#262, §19).
 *
 * Three artifact sources were checked against §19's requirement that a gold
 * query be query-SHAPED, and only one survived:
 *
 *   - hook telemetry — works, but yields keyword chains. One §19 category.
 *   - GitHub issue titles — work-item labels. "cli: add 'bastra logs'
 *     subcommand" is not something anyone types to find a memory.
 *   - session prompts — conversational fragments. "1 passt, 2 opt-in, 3 los
 *     gehts" is meaningless without the turn before it.
 *
 * So the remaining categories — real paraphrases, hard semantic distractors,
 * cross-scope cases, time/version questions, associative cases resolvable only
 * through situational context — need a person writing queries blind. §19 names
 * that source: an independently working second person.
 *
 * This tool is what makes that path usable and auditable. It takes a plain
 * text file of queries, one per line, and stamps the provenance §19 demands.
 * It never opens the vault, and it refuses to run in a directory where it
 * could be tempted to: the whole value of a blind query is that the author did
 * not see the answer.
 *
 * The honesty this cannot enforce, and does not pretend to: nothing here can
 * verify the author kept their eyes closed. What it does is record WHO wrote
 * them and HOW, so a reviewer can weigh it — which is exactly what
 * `authoring_mode` is for.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx src/goldset-blind.ts --in queries.txt --out staged-blind.json \
 *     --origin second_person --by "Sali" \
 *     --mode "wrote 40 retrieval questions from her own memory of the project, vault closed"
