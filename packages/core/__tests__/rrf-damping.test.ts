/**
 * What `RRF_K` actually buys, pinned as behaviour rather than as a number.
 *
 * The damping constant decides how much a rank is worth against mere presence
 * in both arms. At the TREC default of 60 the denominator swamps the rank on
 * pools this size: a memory sitting at rank 20 in BOTH arms outranked a memory
 * at rank 1 in one. #302 wrote that arithmetic out for the score bands; it is a
 * ranking cost too, and `packages/eval/src/rrf-k-beir.ts` measures what it
 * costs on a public corpus.
 *
 * The ordering property lives here rather than in that harness because it is
 * arithmetic: it holds for any two lists, on any corpus, and a test that needs
 * 3 633 documents and a running Ollama to state it is not a test.
 *
 * Runner: node --import tsx --test packages/core/__tests__/rrf-damping.test.ts
