/**
 * Curator demotion (#155) — the engine half of the deterministic staleness
 * pass, pinned as a survival-by-id arm: setDemotions() halves the recall
 * score of a demoted memory and does NOTHING else. By-id resolution, the
 * file on disk, and un-demoted neighbors are untouched; clearing the set
 * restores the original score exactly (demotion is state, not history).
 *
 * Runner: node --import tsx --test packages/core/__tests__/curator-demotion.test.ts
