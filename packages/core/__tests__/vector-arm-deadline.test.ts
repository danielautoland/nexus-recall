/**
 * Per-arm deadline for the dense leg (#342).
 *
 * The two arms have measurably different cost profiles but shared one deadline:
 * BM25 is an in-memory MiniSearch pass, the dense arm needs a warm embedding
 * model. #305 measured the gap on a real host — 734ms for the first call after
 * the model was evicted against ~161ms warm, under a 600ms hook budget. The
 * failure that produced was not "slower recall": the whole call missed the
 * budget, the hook returned nothing, and the turn continued as if there had
 * been nothing to say — while the BM25 arm had had its answer ready for 700ms.
 *
 * What these tests pin:
 *   1. the deadline expires into the EXISTING degradation path, so scores stay
 *      in the BM25 space (one-armed RRF is a different space — see #240/B1)
 *   2. `degraded: "vector-arm-timeout"` is distinguishable from the pre-existing
 *      `"vector-arm-empty"`, so the expiry rate is observable rather than
 *      showing up as quietly worse recall
 *   3. a timeout degradation is NOT cached — the cache key varies on
 *      `embeddings.size()`, which a cold model does not change, so caching a
 *      one-armed answer would freeze it for the whole TTL (the trap #240/B2
 *      closed for the boot window, reachable again through this door)
 *   4. the abandoned embed KEEPS RUNNING — the model finishes loading on the
 *      call that gave up on it, which is the only reason the next call is warm.
 *      Cancelling would re-pay the cold start forever.
 *
 * Runner: node --import tsx --test packages/core/__tests__/vector-arm-deadline.test.ts
