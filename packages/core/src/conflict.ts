/**
 * #205 — conflict marking. When a save contradicts an existing memory
 * (`conflict_with`), the vault must neither silently overwrite the old claim
 * nor grow a silently disagreeing sibling. Instead the existing memory gets a
 * visible, plain-markdown conflict block carrying BOTH claims with provenance
 * and dates — readable in Obsidian, a static viewer, or `cat` alike (same
 * principle as the #140 projections: no viewer becomes the gatekeeper).
 *
 * Resolution is a normal `save_memory` with `overwrite=true`: the rewrite
 * replaces the body wholesale, which removes the block — a deliberate act
 * that the audit log (and with it the #288 journal) records.
