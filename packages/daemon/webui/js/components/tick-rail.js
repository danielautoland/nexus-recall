/** Tick rail: a scroll position shown as marks instead of a scrollbar.
 *
 *  Built for the notice deck, now shared with the live history — same rail,
 *  same behaviour, two lists. Pure UI: it knows an element to draw into and an
 *  element that scrolls, nothing about notices or memories.
 *
 *  Two things it does that a naive version gets wrong, both learned on the
 *  deck:
 *
 *  1. The lit mark comes from the scroll POSITION, not from "which item has
 *     been scrolled past". The latter can never reach the last mark — scrolled
 *     all the way down, the final item sits at the BOTTOM of the port, so the
 *     rail stops short and the list looks like it has more below. A fraction
 *     of the scrollable distance is exact at both ends by construction.
 *
 *  2. The rail is capped in marks. The deck holds a handful of cards, but a
 *     session history holds hundreds — one mark per row would leave a wall of
 *     marks that reads as noise. Past the cap the rail becomes a scale: fewer
 *     marks than rows, the position still exact.
