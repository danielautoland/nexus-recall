/** Live-notice deck (#217) — the presentation half of the notice lane.
 *  managers/live-updates.js owns WHAT is announced; this owns how the pile
 *  looks. It never creates or removes a card, it only reacts to the ones that
 *  are there.
 *
 *  Three rules the deck follows:
 *    1. The newest card covers AT MOST two others. Beyond that a pile stops
 *       reading as a pile and starts reading as clutter, and a busy minute
 *       would bury the map it is reporting on.
 *    2. Everything past those three is counted, not drawn — one small bar
 *       saying how many are still down there.
 *    3. Scrolling is shown by tick marks on the left, not by a scrollbar. The
 *       native one is suppressed: a full-height bar next to a 280px lane is
 *       visually louder than the notices themselves, and the ticks double as a
 *       density readout — you can see at a glance whether three things or
 *       thirty happened.
 *
