/** Galaxy morphology for the Mindspace TEST modes (universe-lab, galaxy-lab).
 *
 *  Nothing in here touches the two shipped modes: `universe` and `galaxy` keep
 *  spiralLocal() in orbit-view.js byte for byte. This file answers two things
 *  those modes get wrong.
 *
 *  1) EVERY non-dwarf cluster rendered the same two-armed spiral (`arm = i % 2`),
 *     so ten projects looked interchangeable.
 *  2) The shape carried no information — arms, tilt and nebulae were all rnd().
 *
 *  The fix hangs the whole Hubble sequence off ONE measured property of a
 *  cluster: its degree concentration, i.e. how much of the cluster's edge mass
 *  hangs off its few biggest hubs. That is not a decorative choice, it is the
 *  actual astrophysics — arm count is driven by central concentration, not by
 *  size. A big bulge stabilises the m=2 density wave (the same condition that
 *  produces a bar), so grand-design two-armed spirals are the CONCENTRATED
 *  ones; low-concentration discs go multi-armed and flocculent. Euclid measures
 *  2-armed at ~60-70% of spirals with the LARGER concentration and 3-armed at
 *  ~15-20% with the smaller, at fixed stellar mass.
 *
 *  So a hub-dominated project genuinely is a barred grand design and a flat one
 *  genuinely is a four-armed Sd. The form is readable AND correct.
 *
 *  Star positions come from the density-wave picture (Lindblad; Ingo Berg's
 *  galaxy renderer uses the same construction): stars ride closed orbits whose
 *  apsides precess with radius. An m-mode perturbation of a circular orbit
 *
 *      r(phi) = a * (1 + e * cos(m * (phi - Omega(a)))),  Omega(a) ~ ln a
 *
 *  makes the arms EMERGE as the crowding of neighbouring orbits instead of
 *  being painted on. Stars stay uniform in phi, so the inter-arm disc fills
 *  itself — which is what a real galaxy looks like: arms are roughly a 2x
 *  density enhancement over a full disc, not two stripes with a void between.
 *
 *  Omega(a) ~ ln a is a logarithmic spiral, so the pitch angle is constant with
 *  radius (the old code used a linear `t * 3.6`, an Archimedean spiral that
 *  wound about half a turn and read as two bent bananas).
 *
 *  Determinism: every random draw goes through rnd(i, salt) from orbit-galaxy,
 *  never Math.random — positions have to be stable across rebuilds, or the
 *  whole map would reshuffle on every live update.
