/**
 * Pool regions and gold-id retirement (#261; §18.1).
 *
 * Two of M0's remaining work items, and they answer different questions about
 * the same zero in Recall@3:
 *
 *   - A gold that ranked 7th and a gold the first stage never surfaced are the
 *     same miss in the metric and opposite problems in the code. far_in_pool
 *     is a ranking failure; oop is a retrieval failure that no re-ranking can
 *     fix. Splitting them is what makes a miss actionable.
 *   - A gold id that no longer exists is not a miss at all. Scoring it as one
 *     silently depresses every number below it, so an unknown id fails the run
 *     unless it is retired on the record.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/stress-regions.test.ts
