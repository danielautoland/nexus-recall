/**
 * The hook says what it measured (#302).
 *
 * The bands are fixed points (30 / 100) on a scale whose meaning is set by the
 * fusion constant. #302 measured the consequence: on the hybrid path 99.9% of
 * hits landed in REQUIRED and the noise floor fired 0.0% of the time, and the
 * arm check explained why — every REQUIRED hit was found by BOTH arms, every
 * OPTIONAL hit by one. The cut at 100 was a test for arm agreement wearing the
 * label of a strength test, and the wording asserted strength anyway.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here:
 *   1. the rank a cut selects follows from the constants, at the shipped k and
 *      at the one it replaced — the arithmetic behind the whole issue;
 *   2. the wording never claims strength or agreement it did not measure —
 *      including the BM25-only path, where no fusion runs at all and the score
 *      has no ceiling (#302 measured top hits into six digits there).
 *
 * Runner: `node --import tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/hook-band-honesty.test.ts`
