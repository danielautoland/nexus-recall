/**
 * `bastra <command> --help` (#330) — the flag documents, it never acts.
 *
 * The defect this guards against: `showHelp` was bound to "no command given",
 * so any command plus --help fell through to the dispatch switch and ran. For
 * `bastra update --help` that meant re-registering every surface and restarting
 * the daemon as the answer to the question what update does.
 *
 * Three gates, because one alone would rot:
 *
 *  1. BEHAVIOUR — spawn the real CLI and assert that help came out and the
 *     command did not run. The writing commands are exercised with --dry-run
 *     as a second net: if the guard ever breaks, this test prints a diff
 *     instead of restarting the daemon on whoever's machine runs the suite.
 *  2. STRUCTURE — the guard sits before the switch and carries no
 *     `!args.command` condition. This is what makes the fix hold for the
 *     commands the behaviour test deliberately does not run (token, config).
 *  3. DRIFT — every dispatched command has its own help section, so a new
 *     command cannot land with nothing to say for itself.
 *
 * Runner: `node --import tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/cli-help.test.ts`
