/**
 * galaxy-lab does not wind itself up (#328).
 *
 * Every star used to get its own angular speed out of its own radius, which
 * makes the arms MATERIAL structures under differential rotation — and those
 * wind up. Measured on the shipped values: 180° of shear across one arm after
 * ~4 minutes, globulars and satellites smeared into arcs along with it. A
 * reload looked like a fix only because the clock is `performance.now()`.
 *
 * omega is a property of the STRUCTURE now. The property this pins is the one
 * that keeps distances: inside a zone, every member turns at exactly the same
 * rate. Asserted on the mechanism, not on a 30-minute stopwatch — but the
 * distance check below runs the real rotation for 30 minutes of model time.
 *
 * Runner: `node --import tsx --test packages/daemon/__tests__/galaxy-lab-winding.test.ts`
