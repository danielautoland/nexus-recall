/**
 * `bastra completion` (#21) — and the drift gate that keeps it honest.
 *
 * A completion script is a copy of the CLI's vocabulary, and copies rot. The
 * failure is quiet and user-facing: Tab keeps offering last release's commands
 * while silently omitting the new one, and it reads as authoritative because
 * it comes from the tool itself. So the real test here is not "does it emit
 * bash syntax" — it is "does COMMANDS still match the dispatch table".
 *
 * Runner: `tsx --test __tests__/cli-completion.test.ts`
