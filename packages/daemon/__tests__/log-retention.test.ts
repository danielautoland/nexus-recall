/**
 * Log retention (#23).
 *
 * The interesting test here is not "old files get deleted" — it is that the
 * retention window can never dip below what the curator mines (30 days). These
 * logs are input to reflex promotion, so a too-eager cleanup would look like
 * housekeeping and behave like silent recall degradation.
 *
 * Runner: `tsx --test __tests__/log-retention.test.ts`
