/**
 * Turn-start prewarm of the embedding model (#361, split out of #350).
 *
 * The assertion lane is the one that lands cold. #342 gave the dense arm a
 * 150ms deadline, which made a cold call CHEAP, not GOOD: past the deadline
 * the arm is dropped (`degraded: "vector-arm-timeout"`) and the hit list comes
 * back BM25-only — the lane arrives on time and says less. #305 measured the
 * cold model as that variance (cold ~860ms → 341ms warm).
 *
 * A turn has a known start: `UserPromptSubmit` fires before any tool call, and
 * since #343 the daemon serves that lane itself, so it sees every turn start
 * without a new client call. One small embed kicked off there — never awaited,
 * never in the lane's critical path — leaves the model resident by the time the
 * first assertion call fires seconds later.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `keep_alive: -1`: that pins ~600MB of RAM across idle gaps
 * for as long as the daemon lives, which is exactly what #78 rejected. The
 * model here is only ever warm while a turn is actually running; the ordinary
 * keep_alive window (#78, default 10m per embed request) lets it fall out of
 * RAM once the work stops.
 */

 * Debounce window — a turn starting inside it needs no warm-up.
 *
 * Sized against the keep_alive the daemon already sends per embed request
 * (#78: default "10m"), so one minute is a wide safety margin even for a user
 * who lowered it: within 60s of the last warm the model is resident under any
 * sane setting, and the call would be pure noise. It also caps the cost of a
 * burst of short turns at one embed per minute of active work.
