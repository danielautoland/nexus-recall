/**
 * The `bastra` command after an npx install (#317).
 *
 * `npx bastra-recall install` runs the guided setup to completion — vault
 * created, clients registered, the runtime pinned under ~/.bastra/runtime
 * (#180) — and then leaves nothing behind that the user can type. `npx`
 * executes a package, it never installs one, so every documented next step
 * (`bastra doctor`, `bastra map`, `bastra import`, `bastra onboard`) answers
 * with "command not found" on a machine that is in fact correctly installed.
 *
 * Fix: at the end of the guided setup, offer the global install ONCE and run
 * it only on an explicit yes — a global install is the user's machine, not
 * ours. Declining is a valid answer, so the decline branch has to leave a
 * working invocation too (`npx bastra-recall <command>`); what must not happen
 * is leaving the setup with no way to reach the CLI at all.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a launcher shim into ~/.bastra/runtime/<version>/: there is
 * no directory on PATH this tool may write to unasked, and a shim would pin
 * the `bastra` command to one version forever — the stale-pin failure #304
 * exists to surface, reintroduced at the entry point.
