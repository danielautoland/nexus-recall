/**
 * `bastra rules cursor [path]` — install the convention layer into a project.
 *
 * Why this is a command and not part of `bastra install cursor`: Cursor has no
 * global, file-based rules location. Its User Rules live in the settings UI,
 * and project rules are `<project>/.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — versioned with the
 * repo. `bastra install` registers MCP globally and often runs from the home
 * directory (the double-click installer does), where a `.cursor/rules/` folder
 * would mean nothing. So the rules layer is an explicit, per-project step: the
 * installer points at it, this command performs it, and nothing gets written
 * into a working directory the user did not name.
