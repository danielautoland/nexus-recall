/**
 * #268 + #226 — one preflight stage in front of the install step.
 *
 * `bastra update` replaced the installation with no awareness of anything: no
 * check for locally modified files, no backup, no verification of what it was
 * pulling. The trigger case for #268 was real — the Cyrillic locale fix lived
 * as a local patch on an installed daemon for days before #253 merged, and any
 * update in that window would have reverted it without a word. And the staged
 * path runs completely unattended (`update-check.ts` → `bastra update
 * --staged`, detached, stdio ignored), so "silently" is literal.
 *
 * ## Why the two issues are one module
 *
 * Both gate the SAME install step, and both must hold on the unattended path.
 * Built separately, they become two independent abort conditions in front of
 * one action — and the fastest way to kill auto-updates for everyone is two
 * guards that can each veto without knowing about the other. So: one preflight,
 * one result object, one place that decides.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * It never repairs. It detects, backs up, and reports; reapplying local changes
 * onto the new version is the patch registry (#269) and deliberately separate.
 * The first version of a guard that can block every update should be able to
 * say "no" and nothing else.
