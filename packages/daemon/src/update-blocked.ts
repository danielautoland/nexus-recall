/**
 * #268 — the report channel for an update that was held back.
 *
 * The unattended path has no reader. `spawnStagedUpdate()` (update-check.ts)
 * starts `bastra update --staged` detached with `stdio: "ignore"`, so every
 * line the preflight prints on a refusal goes nowhere — while the SessionStart
 * hook has ALREADY told the agent "bastra-recall is updating in the background:
 * X → Y … tell the user an update to Y is being applied". If the preflight then
 * refuses, the user has been told something that did not happen, the day
 * throttle is spent, and nothing in the system ever corrects the record.
 *
 * So the staged run leaves its verdict on disk. The next SessionStart reads it
 * and reports the truth instead of repeating the claim; a `bastra update` that
 * actually installs removes it again.
 *
 * Deliberately its own module rather than part of update-preflight.ts: the
 * writer is the CLI, the readers are the SessionStart hook and the daemon's
 * auto-trigger, and the hook runs on a 500 ms budget — it should not pull in
 * the hashing/spawn machinery of the preflight just to read one small JSON file.
