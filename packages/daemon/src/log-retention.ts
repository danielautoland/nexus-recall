/**
 * Telemetry log retention — bounded disk, without cutting off the readers.
 *
 * `~/.bastra/logs/events-<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` is already partitioned by day, so
 * the classic "rename to .1, .2, .3 at a size cap" rotation (#23 as filed) is
 * the wrong shape here: it would interleave two naming schemes over the same
 * data and make the day a file encodes unreadable. What the files actually
 * lack is an end — nothing ever deletes them, so a long-lived install grows by
 * 1-3 MB a day forever.
 *
 * So: delete by age, not by size.
 *
 * The one hard constraint is that these logs are not just logs — they are
 * input. `curator-run.ts` mines the last 30 days to decide reflex promotions,
 * and `bastra bridges` mines them for trigger candidates. A retention that
 * dips under the curator's window would silently degrade recall quality while
 * looking like nothing more than tidy housekeeping. Hence RETENTION_FLOOR_DAYS:
 * the configured value can go up, never below what the readers need.
