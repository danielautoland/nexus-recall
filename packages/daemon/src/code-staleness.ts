/**
 * Does this process still run the code that is on the disk? (#329)
 *
 * Node loads modules once. A `git pull && npm run build`, a `brew upgrade`
 * without a restart, or a staged update whose idle-restart never fired all
 * leave a daemon serving what it read at boot — and reporting that build's
 * version in /health, in the MCP handshake and to the update check. On 02.08.
 * a daemon ran 16 hours past a rebuild: /health said 0.8.9 while the disk had
 * 0.9.0, and nothing anywhere said the answer was out of date.
 *
 * `version.ts` made the build-time drift (literals vs package.json)
 * structurally impossible. This is the other axis: disk vs process.
 *
 * It does NOT restart anything. A service that pulls itself out from under a
 * user mid-session is worse than a stale one — so this only ever says so.
 *
 * Two states, deliberately not merged (they call for different actions):
 *
 *   rebuilt    the entrypoint on disk is newer than the one running.
 *              A restart picks the new code up.
 *   not-built  package.json says another version, but the build has not moved.
 *              Somebody pulled and did not build; a restart changes nothing.
