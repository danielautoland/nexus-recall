# Memory Schema

This schema defines one stored memory or document sidecar. Files are plain markdown with YAML frontmatter so they remain editable in Obsidian and by hand.

The schema supports:

1. autonomous saves when a durable lesson, preference, workflow, decision, or project fact is learned;
2. pre-action recall through `recall_when`;
3. cross-project reuse through scope, tags, topics, wikilinks, and `related_via`;
4. document and bookmark retrieval through the same vault/search layer;
5. local privacy controls through `sensitivity`.

## Storage Layout

The configured vault root comes from `BASTRA_VAULT_PATH` (legacy `NEXUS_VAULT_PATH` is accepted).

The vault scanner walks recursively and loads any `.md` file whose frontmatter has a recognized `type`. Ordinary Obsidian notes can live next to memories and are ignored.

Current write routing:

| Kind | Folder |
|---|---|
| user preferences | `memories/user/` |
| all-project memories | `memories/all-projects/` |
| project-scoped memories | `memories/projects/<scope>/` |
| bookmarks | `bookmarks/` |
| document sidecars | `dokumentationen/<scope>/` |

Legacy flat vaults still load because scanning is recursive and does not require files to be under those folders.

The active text index is in-memory MiniSearch/BM25. Optional embeddings are stored at `<vault>/.bastra/embeddings.json`. Audit logs and trash are stored under `<vault>/.bastra/`.

## Minimal Frontmatter

All normal memories and document sidecars share these required fields:

```yaml
---
id: css-input-focus-ring-stacking
title: "Don't stack focus styles on inputs"
type: lesson
summary: "Stacking ring + outline + custom :focus on nested inputs causes double focus rings. Use a single :focus-visible style."
topic_path: [css, input, focus]
tags: [css, input, focus-ring, ui-bug]
scope: all-projects
recall_when:
  - creating new input component
  - writing input or form css
  - focus or accessibility styling
related: [css-effects-stacking-antipattern]
related_via: []
sensitivity: team
source: "carnexus, recurring lesson"
confidence: 0.95
created: 2026-04-15
updated: 2026-05-01
---
```

The markdown body follows the frontmatter. For lessons, lead with the rule, then explain why it matters and how to apply it.

## Core Fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `id` | yes | Stable slug. Usually filename without `.md`. |
| `title` | yes | Human-readable title shown in recall hits. |
| `type` | yes | Memory/document kind. See type table below. |
| `summary` | yes | One dense sentence, max 400 characters. |
| `topic_path` | yes | Hierarchical topic path, e.g. `[bastra-recall, search, ranking]`. |
| `tags` | yes | Flat retrieval tags. At least one. |
| `scope` | yes | Applicability boundary, e.g. `all-projects`, `user-preference`, or a project name. |
| `recall_when` | yes | Concrete future contexts where this memory should surface. |
| `recall_when_expanded` | no | Machine-generated doc2query paraphrases of the triggers (#117), indexed at a lower weight. Written by the `TriggerExpander`; absent until expanded. |
| `recall_when_expanded_src` | no | Short hash of the source fields the paraphrases were derived from; the expander regenerates only when it changes. |
| `related` | no | Manual related memory ids. Body wikilinks are mirrored here by the save path. |
| `related_via` | no | Automatic related edges from embedding similarity. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `sensitivity` | no | `private`, `team`, or `public`. Defaults to `team`. |
| `source` | no | Provenance or reason this memory exists. |
| `confidence` | no | Number from `0` to `1`. Defaults to `1.0`. |
| `created` | yes | ISO date. Auto-set by save paths. |
| `updated` | yes | ISO date. Auto-set by save/update paths. |

## Types

Recognized `type` values:

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `lesson` | Anti-pattern or correction learned from failure |
| `preference` | Stable project-scoped or working preference |
| `project-fact` | Stable fact about a project or feature area |
| `meta-working` | Durable fact about how the assistant should work |
| `decision` | Committed design/product/architecture decision |
| `workflow` | Repeatable process or checklist |
| `reference` | Pointer to an external or internal resource |
| `user-preference` | Cross-project user preference |
| `bookmark` | Saved URL with bookmark metadata |
| `doc` | Document sidecar for file/document retrieval |

## Recall Fields

`recall_when` is the most important retrieval field. It is boosted above title, tags, topic path, summary, and body in the MiniSearch index. If embeddings are enabled, the same authored text also contributes to semantic recall because it is included in the embedding text.

`recall_when_expanded` (doc2query, #117) holds LLM-generated paraphrases of the triggers in *different* words, so a reworded query weeks later still fires on the lexical layer without any query-time model cost. A local Ollama model generates them offline at write time (and backfills existing memories); only paraphrases that retrieve their own memory in a self-test are kept. They are indexed below the hand-written `recall_when` (weight 2 vs 5). The feature is on by default when Ollama is the embedding provider; set `BASTRA_TRIGGER_EXPAND=0` to disable it.

Good values describe future actions:

```yaml
recall_when:
  - creating new input component
  - writing input or form css
  - focus or accessibility styling
```

Weak values are generic:

```yaml
recall_when:
  - css
  - frontend
```

The current matching stack is BM25 with prefix/fuzzy search, optionally fused with vector search through Reciprocal Rank Fusion. It is not SQLite/FTS5.

## Relationships

`related` is a manual list of memory ids. The save path also extracts `[[memory-id]]` wikilinks from the body and mirrors them into `related`, excluding links in the auto-related section.

`related_via` is maintained by the optional `RelatedEnricher`:

```yaml
related_via:
  - id: css-effects-stacking-antipattern
    reason: "cosine 0.812"
    score: 0.812
```

When recall is called with `expand_hops: 1`, one-hop `related_via` neighbors can be added to the result set with a reduced score.

The auto-related body section is managed between marker comments:

```markdown
## Auto-Related <!-- bastra:auto-related:start -->

- [[css-effects-stacking-antipattern]] (cosine 0.81)

<!-- bastra:auto-related:end -->
```

Do not manually edit inside that section.

## Lifecycle And Ranking Fields

These optional fields affect staleness and recall ranking:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `valid_until` | Explicit ISO date after which the memory expires |
| `expires_after_days` | Override for type-based expiration defaults |
| `last_reviewed_at` | ISO date of the last manual review |
| `stale_status` | Optional persisted status: `fresh`, `aging`, `stale`, `expired` |
| `obsolete` | If true, the memory is filtered out of normal recall |
| `replaces` | Memory id this one replaces |
| `superseded_by` | Newer memory that supersedes this one |

Staleness is computed lazily during recall. Stale and expired memories are downranked; obsolete memories are removed from normal search results.

### Valence And Reflex Fields (#217)

Optional fields modelling the human-memory axes *feeling* and *reflex*:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `salience` | `0`–`1`: how emotionally charged the capture moment was. High salience slows aging (effective expiration days × `1 + salience`) and may rank higher — the ranking multiplier runs shadow-only by default and goes live only via `BASTRA_SALIENCE_RANK=live` after a measured lift (`salience-lift` eval). |
| `emotion` | Tone of the capture moment: `frustration`, `success`, `risk`, `neutral`. Drives the capture rules and tints the glow core in the vault map. |
| `recall_mode` | `reflex` or `deliberate` (absent = `deliberate`). Reflex memories may self-inject — budgeted, max 2 per turn — when one of their `recall_when` phrases hard-matches a prompt (deterministic token match, no fuzzy scoring). Set `reflex` ONLY after the user explicitly confirmed a promotion; the curator proposes candidates via the pending-suggestions relay, it never wires them itself. |

Capture rules: frustration signals ("schon wieder", emphatic caps) → `emotion: frustration`, `salience: 0.8`; a hard-won fix after >2 iterations → `emotion: success`, `salience: 0.7`; explicit user marking ("merk dir das gut") → `salience: 0.9`. Omit all three fields for routine saves — never invent them. On overwrite without these fields, existing values are preserved (same rule as `write_origin`).

## Privacy Field

`sensitivity` controls which callers can see a memory:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `private` | Hidden from external MCP/REST callers unless `allow_private: true` |
| `team` | Default; visible to local AI tools |
| `public` | Safe for broader cross-surface exposure |

Both recall and direct load paths enforce this filter.

## Augmentation Fields

General optional fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `affects_files` | Repo paths this memory applies to |
| `status` | Free-form state such as `stable`, `in-progress`, `planned`, `open` |
| `issues` | Related issue ids such as `#42` |

Bookmark-only fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `url` | Saved URL |
| `categories` | Bookmark categories |
| `read_status` | `unread`, `read`, or `archived` |
| `og_image` | Open Graph image URL |
| `saved_at` | ISO timestamp |
| `source_app` | App/source that saved the bookmark |

Document-only fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `original_path` | Original file path for the document |
| `linked_file` | If true, original remains outside the vault |
| `document_category` | `vertrag`, `rechnung`, `notiz`, `code`, `bild`, or `sonstiges` |
| `folder_path` | Folder path used by document tools |
| `needs_review` | Auto-inbox review flag |
| `ai_suggested_folder` | Suggested target folder for review UI |
| `content_hash` | SHA-256 content hash for duplicate detection |
| `content_size` | Original file size in bytes |
| `location` | Optional geo metadata: `{ lat, lon, place?, source? }` |

## Body

Recommended body for lessons:

## Validation Rules

The current Zod schema rejects files that have a recognized memory `type` but invalid frontmatter. Required validations include:

- non-empty `id`, `title`, `summary`, `scope`;
- `summary` length at most 400 characters;
- recognized `type`;
- non-empty `topic_path`, `tags`, and `recall_when`;
- `confidence` between `0` and `1`;
- valid enum values for `sensitivity`, `read_status`, and location source when present;
- positive integer lifecycle overrides where required.

Files without a recognized `type` are treated as ordinary notes and skipped, not as schema failures.

The save path rejects duplicate ids at the destination path unless `overwrite: true` is passed. It does not require `scope` to come from a registry.
